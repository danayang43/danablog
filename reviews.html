			<h5>AUGUST 16, 2022</h5>
			<h1 style="font-size:30px">I Want To Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki</h1>
			<h3 style="font-size:15px"><em>Author: Baek Se-hee (translated to English by Anton Hur)</em></h3>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				<em>I Want To Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki</em> is a  Korean novel that has been translated to seven Asian languages and received praise from fans around the world. After being urged by innumerable "booktoks" to read this supposedly eye-opening and beautiful novel, I finally caved in and ordered a copy. The title caught my attention, as tteokbokki is a popular Korean dish that never fails to make me salivate. The cover art is also nicely stylized and soothing. However, after finishing the book's contents, I feel no lingering emotions, only a mild disappointment with what I have just read.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				The book consists of the narrator's therapy sessions with her psychiatrist, interspersed with chapters of arbitrary short stories and reflections of the narrator's past. The book's structure is messy and failed to hook me in from the start. It seems as if the book is continuously lacking in any form of emotion- the narrator's conversations with her psychiatrist are bland and awkward; of course, this may also be a byproduct of the book's translation from Korean to English, as the nuances of stories are frequently lost or muddled when translated to different languages. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px"> Her back-and-forths with her psychiatrist remind me of advertisements in which a child confesses to an adult about a problem, asking, 'So what should I do?' to which the adult brings out the advertised product as a convenient solution; the child speaks in an artificial tone that so obviously suggests that they do in fact know what to do and are merely acting asinine so that the targeted audience will be drawn in. In the narrator's case, she repeatedly states her problems-that she is unconfident, always thinks in extremes, etc.- and the psychiatrist gives her (in my opinion, unhelpful) advice on what to do, but the narrator keeps listing the same problems each session and never changes. I did not feel a sense of closure after the sessions ended, and I instead felt like the narrator barely improved as a person, if even at all.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				Nevertheless, I do appreciate one aspect of the book: the fact that the narrator is completely candid and has no problem stating what she really thinks, even if her opinions are considered problematic and are frowned upon by most people in society. For instance, she bluntly says that she evaluates others on their appearances, that she gets jealous when others get compliments on their looks, and that she judges people who are overweight. Although honesty should always be the bare minimum, I am surprised that the narrator is frank to this extent, and I admire her for this at the same time.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				All in hall, however, I felt unsatisfied after finishing the book, and instead of mulling over its contents as I usually do with other books, I lamented over the hours I lost reading it.

			<h5>AUGUST 16, 2022</h5>
			<h1 style="font-size:30px">The Bright Hour</h1>
			<h3 style="font-size:15px"><em>Author: Nina Riggs</em></h3>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				After finishing Paul Kalanithi's beautiful memoir <em>When Breath Becomes Air</em>, I was recommended to read Riggs's memoir<em> The Bright Hour</em>. Like Kalanithi, Riggs was diagnosed with cancer and wrote a book centered on it, documenting the relationships in her life, especially with her husband and children, and how they were impacted while she grappled with the deadly disease. Unfortunately, Riggs is no longer alive; but I will be presenting my honest opinions on her book nonetheless.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				I am a big fan of metaphors, flowery language, philosophical thoughts, and uncommon diction. Truthfully, it makes me feel smarter. However, there comes a time when this extravagant language is too much, and I start to see the author as nothing more than someone trying too hard to become the next literary genius. In Riggs's case, she fills every page to the brim with these excessive descriptions, and it is so repetitive and unnecessary that I sometimes find myself skimming over them. I understand that Riggs was a literature major, but I see no need for her over-the-top language in a memoir that is supposed to be true to the heart and not garnished with irrelevant details. Many times, she strays so far from the situation at hand that I have no idea what she is talking about. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px">
				Writing style aside, I liked reading about Riggs's relationship with her husband, John. It was really nice to see John's genuine love for Riggs, and the fact that he was always by her side supporting her, even by her deathbed, really warmed my heart. However, I would say that about 10% of the book is about Ralph Emerson, Riggs's great-great-great grandfather (or something like that), who was apparently some great writer centuries ago. She constantly writes, 'Emerson would say...' and then insert a philosophical idea. After a few chapters of her bringing him up, I began to feel irritated: yes, we understand that your great-great-great grandfather was well known in his time, but it is the 21st century, and nobody cares anymore. The memoir is about YOU. In fact, it feels like Riggs was using his name to push herself onto a pedestal, as a way to boost her reputation. I was deeply annoyed by the constant interruptions of her own stories with 'my great-great-great grandfather.'
